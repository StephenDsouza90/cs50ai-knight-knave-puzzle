# CS50AI Knights and Knaves Puzzle

This is an exercise for the course CS50AI's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python. It adds knowledge in a way that an AI algorithm can understand to solve the Knights and Knaves Puzzle.

## Background

In 1978, logician Raymond Smullyan published “What is the name of this book?”, a book of logical puzzles. Among the puzzles in the book were a class of puzzles that Smullyan called “Knights and Knaves” puzzles.

In the puzzle, the following information is given:
- Each character is either a knight or a knave.
- A knight will always tell the truth: if knight states a sentence, then that sentence is true.
- Conversely, a knave will always lie: if a knave states a sentence, then that sentence is false.

The objective of the puzzle is, given a set of sentences spoken by each of the characters, determine, for each character, whether that character is a knight or a knave.

## Tasks

The tasks in this exercise was to implement a knowledge base for the given puzzles. The knowledge base included some sentences said by some players and had some inferred implications. Based on the sentences and implications, the AI algorithm (given by the instructor) would understand and solve the puzzle.
